Vienna is the federal capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary
 city, with a population of about 1.8 million[1] (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's
 population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in
 the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before
 the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second
 largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the
 United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic,
 Slovakia, and Hungary.
